# NATO-alphabet

This is a project to use the NATO phonetic alphabets, so that we can spell out various things on the telephone.

Because it is often really important for the other side to know exactly what it is that you said and which letters you are spelling out. 
So that they dont mistaken your E for a B or, T for a C, because it all sounds really similar.

The is a program that works in the console and it allows the user to enter a word.

eg: Enter a word: Alena

Then it return a list of all of the NATO phonetic alphabet that matches each of the letters in the given word.

['Alfa', 'Lima', 'Echo', 'November', 'Alfa']

So this way  we can use this tool and be able to spell any word we want easily using NATO phonetic alphabet.
